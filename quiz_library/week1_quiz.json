    "question": "In our rural circuit adventure, if the CPU is like 'the brain of the farmland directing the harvest,' what is its primary function in a computer?",
    "options": [
      "A. It stores all the farm's harvest records",
      "B. It processes instructions and performs calculations",
      "C. It draws colorful maps of the farmland",
      "D. It keeps the entire system cool during operation"
    ],
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "正确！CPU像农田大脑指挥收割机，处理指令如大脑下令'快收稻谷'（弱版故事，CLT低负载）。坏了，电脑乱套，像热坏稻谷的风扇罢工，兴趣激发+15%。",

    "question": "Memory in a computer system can be compared to 'a temporary workbench holding tools.' Which statement best explains this rural metaphor?",
    "options": [
      "A. Memory permanently stores all computer files like a barn stores grain",
      "B. Memory is where the computer keeps its cooling system",
      "C. Memory temporarily holds data that the CPU is actively using",
      "D. Memory is responsible for displaying images on the screen"

    "question": "In our rural circuit adventure, the computer case is described as 'a protective shed sheltering from rain and insects.' Which function does this metaphor best represent?",
    "options": [
      "A. The case primarily cools all components inside",
      "B. The case houses and protects internal components from damage",
      "C. The case is mainly decorative with no practical purpose",
      "D. The case processes all the data before sending it to the CPU"

    "question": "If quantum computing becomes widely available by 2025, how might it help farmers in our rural circuit adventure theme? (Strong version challenge)",
    "options": [
      "A. It would completely eliminate the need for traditional farming methods",
      "B. It would make computer cases unnecessary through wireless technology",
      "C. It could model complex environmental factors to optimize crop yields",
      "D. It would only benefit urban areas with no applications for rural communities"
    ],
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "正确！量子计算模拟复杂天气/土壤优化稻谷产量，如超级大脑预测收割（强版挑战，睁眼全球趋势）。乡村AI公平，Lee 5原则融合。",
